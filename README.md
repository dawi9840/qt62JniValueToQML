About the android/libs/car_framework.jar file:    
File: [click me](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uLDje9tRJMZqveUOVi5OUoK3VJaT2BBc/view).   
The car_framework.jar file size is large than 25 MB. So I put it in the cloud drive. **Please download from cloud drive**, and put it in the folder path (qt62JniValueToQML/qt62JniValueToQML/android/libs/).
