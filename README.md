# qt62JniValueToQML
This example is using Android Qt 6.2.8 Clang arm64-v8a compiler to  receive the Android value(Java value) through QJni and use Qt emit function to display on QML.  

About the android/libs/car_framework.jar file:  
The car_framework.jar file size is large than 25 MB. So I put it in the cloud drive. Please download from cloud drive, and put it in the folder path (qt62JniValueToQML/qt62JniValueToQML/android/libs/).
